# Chapter 1. Recap

This chapter recaps most of the materials you learned in Codeacademy lessons. We'll go through each script during the interactive sessions in the morning. 

The tutor will execute and shortly discuss each statement, show you what can go wrong and how to fix it, and where to look for additional information about Python functions and modules.

Ghe goal of the interactive sessions is to
 - interactively recap the Codeacademy lessons
 - give you the opportunity to ask questions about topics or problems you encountered in the Codeacademy lessons.
 
 The scripts in this chapter cover the following topics:

0. `debugging.py`: covers some of the errors you might encounter when writing your scripts.
1. `strings`: quick introduction to manipulating strings (pieces of text)
2. `conditionals.py`: introduction to flow control (decision making).
3. `functions.py`: introduction to Python functions
4. `lists and dicts.py`: introduction to lists and dictionaries (keu-valie stores) and their manipulation
5. `loops.py`: introduction to iteration i.e. going through all items in a list
6. `modules.py`: introduction to Python modules (bundled pieces of functionality)

`utils.py` contains the functions used in `modules.py`
